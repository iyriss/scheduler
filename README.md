# Interview Scheduler

Using the latest tools and techniques while building and testing, Interview Scheduler is a React application that allows users to book and cancel interviews:

* Interview Scheduler focuses on a single page application (SPA). 
* Data is persisted by the API server using a PostgreSQL database. 
* The client application communicates with an API server over HTTP, using the JSON format.
* Jest tests are used through the development of the project.
